## Hi, I'm Siddharth Hasanabadi ! 

I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Electrical Engineering (specializing in Wireless Communication) at North Carolina State University.

Previously:

    Embedded Wireless Stack Developer at Analog Devices (Automotive Division)
    Undergraduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering from VIT Vellore

I hold an interest in Wireless Protocols, Embedded Software Development, and Signal & Image Processing. I'm also passionate about upcycling old electronics.

Currently, I’m exploring LTE/5G Communication, Signal Processing, and RF Design for wireless systems. In my free time i'm starting to mess around with Software Defined Radios ( RTLSDRv4)
